Linear Regression Example
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Linear Regression using Python's scikit-learn library and a sample dataset. The goal of this example is to show how to build a basic linear regression model using a single feature from the dataset and plot the results for better understanding.

Features
Linear Regression: A model that fits a linear equation to the observed data.
Visualization: A scatter plot showing the actual data points and the fitted regression line to visualize the relationship between the input feature and the target variable.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries installed:

scikit-learn

`matplotlib
numpy`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code

`pip install scikit-learn matplotlib numpy`

Running the Code
Clone the repository to your local machine (after uploading it to GitHub).
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy code

`python linear_regression.py`

This will create a plot showing the actual data points (in blue) and the fitted regression line (in red).

Understanding the Code
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded using `load_diabetes()` from scikit-learn.
Feature Selection: Only a single feature (e.g., BMI) is used for this example.
Model Training: A LinearRegression model is created and trained on the selected feature and the target variable.
Prediction and Visualization: The model predicts the target variable, and the results are plotted using matplotlib.
